# TaskManagerApp
Task Manager is a WPF app using MVVM arhitecture. It is designed to help users organize their daily tasks and increase their productivity. The application allows users to create and manage multiple to-do lists, each containing various tasks with descriptions, deadlines, priorities, and categories. The application also features a hierarchical structure for organizing the to-do lists, with the ability to create sub to-do lists within each to-do list. This is visualized in the UI as a Tree View. Users can mark tasks as done and view their progress with detailed statistics. The user can save his current to-do lists and open the save file to continue managing them at a later time.
